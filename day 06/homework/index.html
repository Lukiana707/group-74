Single-page websites are web applications that load all content dynamically within one HTML page. 
They use JavaScript to update the content without refreshing the page, offering a smooth and fast user experience. 
Examples include portfolios, landing pages, and some modern web apps.

Multi-page websites consist of multiple HTML pages, each with its own URL and content. 
Navigating between pages involves full page reloads. These are ideal for complex sites like blogs, e-commerce platforms,
or encyclopedias like Wikipedia.
