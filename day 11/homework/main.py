#The purpose of the while loop in Python is to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a specified condition evaluates to True.
 

#WHAT IS THE imilarities and differences between For loop and While loop
#1.   A for loop is typically used when the number of iterations is known beforehand.
#2.  A while loop is used when the number of iterations is not known in advance and depends on a condition.
